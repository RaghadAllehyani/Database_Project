Step1:
Private clinic (Clinic_ID, PhoneNumber, City, ZipCode)
Employee (ID, FName, LName, PhoneNumber, B_date, gender, address,
Salary, Jop_Type, D_No)
Department (D_No, D_Name, mngrID)
Client (C_ID, Address, Name, gender, Contact_No, Appointment number, 
Appointment time, ID)
Room (room_ID, room_type)
Step8a:
Dentists(ID, Degree)
Dietitians (ID, Type of specialist)
Dermatologist (ID, Experience)
Nurses(ID, Long time work)
Receptionist (ID, Typing_speed) 
Manger (ID)

Normalization:
1NF:
Private clinic (Clinic_ID#, PhoneNumber, City, ZipCode) this table is in 
the 1NF Because it fulfills all the conditions
Employee (ID#, FName, LName, PhoneNumber, B_date, gender, address, 
Salary, Jop_Type, D_No) this table is in the 1NF Because it fulfills all the 
conditions
Department (D_No#, D_Name, mngrID) this table is in the 1NF Because 
it fulfills all the conditions
Room (room_ID#, room_type)this table is in the 1NF Because it fulfills 
all the conditions
Manger(ID#): This table contains repeating values in the department 
table. So it is not in 1NF.Then we will delete it.
Client (C_ID#, Address, Name, gender, Contact_No, (Appointment 
number, Appointment time#, ID)): In this table there will be repeating 
groups because the client may visit the clinic more than once, and every 
time he may have a different appointment number and a different 
appointment time and will be served by a different receptionist
We will create the following tables:
Client (C_ID#, Address, Name, gender, Contact_No)
Appointment: (C_ID#, Appointment time#,Appointment number, ID)
According to the system, if the time is 10 a.m., for example, the 
appointment number will always be 3 and the receptionist will be the 
owner of the number 130 because it will be the time of his shift, so 
 Appointment number and ID They fully depend on Appointment time
so it is in 2NF
Dentists(ID#, Degree) this table is in the 1NF Because it fulfills all the 
conditions
Dietitians (ID#, Type of specialist)this table is in the 1NF Because it 
fulfills all the conditions
Dermatologist (ID#, Experience)this table is in the 1NF Because it fulfills 
all the conditions
Nurses(ID#, Long time work)this table is in the 1NF Because it fulfills all 
the conditions
Receptionist (ID#, Typing_speed) this table is in the 1NF Because it 
fulfills all the conditions
2NF:
Private clinic (Clinic_ID#, PhoneNumber, City, ZipCode) the relation is in 
1NF, all non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the entire 
key
Employee (ID#, FName, LName, PhoneNumber, B_date, gender, address, 
Salary, Jop_Type, D_No) the relation is in 1NF, all non-key attributes are 
fully functionally dependent on the entire key
Department (D_No#, D_Name, mngrID)the relation is in 1NF, all nonkey attributes are fully functionally dependent on the entire key
Room (room_ID#, room_type) the relation is in 1NF, all non-key 
attributes are fully functionally dependent on the entire key
Client (C_ID#, Address, Name, gender, Contact_No)the relation is in 
1NF, all non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the entire 
key
Appointment: (C_ID#, Appointment time#,Appointment number, ID) 
the relation is in 1NF, all non-key attributes are fully functionally 
dependent on the entire key
Dentists(ID#, Degree) the relation is in 1NF, all non-key attributes are 
fully functionally dependent on the entire key
Dietitians (ID#, Type of specialist)the relation is in 1NF, all non-key 
attributes are fully functionally dependent on the entire key
Dermatologist (ID#, Experience)the relation is in 1NF, all non-key 
attributes are fully functionally dependent on the entire key
Nurses(ID#, Long time work)the relation is in 1NF, all non-key attributes 
are fully functionally dependent on the entire key
Receptionist (ID#, Typing_speed)the relation is in 1NF, all non-key 
attributes are fully functionally dependent on the entire key
